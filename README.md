# Tom's Personal Page

## Objective
This is a new version of my personal page to replace the old one which can be found [here](https://tomyip0010.github.io/old_personal_page/). 

## Web Content
The current web page is a standalone one-page HTML which is divided into four parts, including 

* welcome section
* personal information section
* porfolio section
* skill section
* contact me section

## Stack used
 
 * HTML
 * CSS
 * Javascript
 * jQuery
 * Bootstrap 3
 * Animate CSS

## Implementation

### Main Practice
I believe that skills can only be improved by practicing and copying. I try to clone the design of [A-damn underwear](https://www.adamunderwear.com/) and as much functionality as I can. [A-damn underwear](https://www.adamunderwear.com/) use a parallax scrolling effect which is fascinated and with simple and elegant design, I decided to try to make a similar style site as a practice. Through out this practice, I learnt how to use parallax, the underline animation, svg aninmation, the implementation of CSS Pseudo-elements (e.g: :before, :after)
 
### Basic Layout

In order to practice my skills, I didn't use bootstrap's grid system for mobile responsive as the backbone structure. Instead I am using flexbox and basic html and css to accomplish the task. Beside, I decide to not including any external javascript library and build the animation by using [Animate CSS](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/). 

### Welcome Section

This consists a short video of Hong Kong, to share with you guys my lovely hometown and a welcome box.

### Personal Information Section

With a paragraph of self-introduction and a picture of me. A timeline of my journey of learning web development can be toggled by clicking the 'more' button under the paragraph.

### Porfolio Section

Both the profolio and skill section used the [Animate CSS](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) to reveal the items when the section is scrolled into view. 

### Contact Section

Visitor can find my contacts through clicks on logos of facebook, github and linkedin.
